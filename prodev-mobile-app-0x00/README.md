npx create-expo-app@latest .
```

* Chose the **Expo Router** template when prompted by the CLI.

### 3. Modify the Home Screen

* Opened: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
* Updated text from:

  <Text className="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome!</Text>
  ```

  to:

  ```tsx
  <Text className="text-2xl font-bold">** First App Created**</Text>
  ```

## üîÑ Observations from `npm run reset-project`

### Command Run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

### Observed Behavior:

* The Metro bundler cache and any previously built JavaScript bundles were cleared.
* The development server stopped and restarted cleanly.
* Any lingering or corrupted builds were removed.
* Useful for fixing odd build behaviors or component updates not reflecting properly.
* Ensured a fresh development state without deleting the source code.

## Summary

The setup process for the first mobile app using Expo Router was completed successfully. The app was scaffolded, modified, and tested on real devices. The `reset-project` command was confirmed to be a powerful tool for clearing state and ensuring a clean slate during development.
