# üì± Mobile Development Environment Setup

This README documents the full setup process for configuring a mobile development environment using **React Native** with the **Expo Framework**. The setup is done on a **Windows machine** and tested on an **Android device** using **Expo Go**.

This environment is essential for upcoming mobile projects and ensures that development and testing can be done without an emulator.
